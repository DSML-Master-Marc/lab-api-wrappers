# Lab | API Wrappers

In this lab, you will be contrasting using OpenWeatherMap REST calls directly with calling the pyowm wrapper. 

You will need an [OpenWeather API key](https://home.openweathermap.org/)#

Make sure you limit your queries so you don't run queries on a loop. Always loop up limit methods.
